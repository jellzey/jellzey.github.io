     I found this Newcomb EDT-29 MV turntable at a flea market and as soon as I saw the color inside, I bought it. I see a lot of old AV equipment from schools but nothing ever looked as cool as this. The mustard yellow and fake wood grain are an unbeatable combo and it just feels like a rugged piece of equipment when you pick it up. When I found it, it was not in great shape. The tonearm lock was missing along with 2 feet, it didn't make any sound, and the power was intermittent. Cosmetically it was doing pretty good other than a couple scratches so I was determined to restore its function to match its looks.

    I started with the tonearm rest. You can see here where the piece broke off that used to lock the tonearm in place. I found some pictures of the same model to get an idea of what the original looked like. The plastic extended to accept a thumbscrew that could be tightened to pinch the wall of the headshell, holding it in place.

    My solution was a piece of steel bent to match the angle of the plastic channel and epoxied in place. I tapped it and threaded an M4 thumb screw in. The steel was blued to keep the rust away.

    The notch on the right side of the tone arm wall is where the lock engages.

    Surprisingly, the rubber drive wheel was in great shape. You can tell the speed selector is a leftover from the previous era of design. It looks pretty out of place against that mustard chassis. I removed all the old grease and re-applied some fresh stuff to the whole mechanism. That lightbulb in front strobes with the 60Hz against a pattern on the platter to ensure acccurate speed.

    Each row of dots is for a different speed setting.

    When the record is moving, speed is adjusted until the corresponding dot pattern syncs up with the strobe.
    <img src="images\BT-turntable\img8.jpg" title="img8"/>
    As the speed adjustment knob is turned, a mechanical linkage shifts the position of a magnet in relation to an aluminum disc that is coupled to the motor shaft. It's an eddy current brake controling the speed!

    I was delighted to find that the feet I assumed had gone missing were rattling around inside the cabinet broken but not lost.
    <img src="images\BT-turntable\img28.jpg" title="img28"/>
    After a very complicated glue-up, the feet were back in business. On to the electronics...

    All carbon comp resistors and axial electrolytics. Some might be able to smell this picture.

    The first thing I noticed was this leaking cap. I tested its ESR and it was wide open.

    I spent a long time tracing out the circuit for no real reason other than curiosity. A permanent marker is a huge help when tracing a board like this.

    I made an error-laiden schematic

    And ultimately realized that I wasted my time when I looked inside the cabinet and saw a full schematic complete with test voltages.
