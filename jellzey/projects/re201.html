     I restored this Space Echo for a local music store after it had been abandoned by a tech in the past. It had a ton of things wrong with it and it needed many hours and new parts to get it running again. When I recieved it, it was disassembled with most of the screws missing. The motor wasnt turning and to make things worse, I found that a lot of the audio wiring had been undone or redone incorrectly.

    I was originally planning on tracing the boards and using a schematic to help me reconnect the loose wires but I got lucky and another customer dropped off the same model for a tune up so I at least had a reference to take pictures of.
    <img src="images/re201/img3.jpg" title="img4"/>
    An entire switch missing is not a good sign.
    <img src="images/re201/img4.jpg" title="img5"/>
    I found the switch inside connected to a PCB. The soldering was looking pretty rough.
    <img src="images/re201/img6.jpg" title="img6"/>
    Looks like someone replaced the coax without desoldering the old stuff.
    <img src="images/re201/img7.jpg" title="img7"/>
    Where does this go??
    <img src="images/re201/img8.jpg" title="img8"/>
    That's why I was smelling burning plastic.
    <img src="images/re201/img16.jpg" title="img9"/>
    I was very happy to have a reference machine at this point. It made this job a lot easier
    <img src="images/re201/img27.jpg" title="img10"/>
    It was an "intence" soldering job.
    <img src="images/re201/img30.jpg" title="img12"/>
    After I made sure that the drive circuit was all there, the motor wouldn't turn. I started investigating the motor board.
    <img src="images/re201/img35.jpg" title="img13"/>
    It was almost impossible with the board soldered in the chassis so I desoldered all of the connections and began to check all the possible suspects.
    <img src="images/re201/img38.jpg" title="img14"/>
    Every single transistor tested normal and so did all of the capacitors.
    <img src="images/re201/img49.jpg" title="img15"/>
    I connected just the motor circuit back to the chassis and tested it again. It started moving but was sensitive to movement so I knew it had to be a mechanical issue.
    <img src="images/re201/img53.jpg" title="img16"/>
    The problem was barely visible but if you look closely, you can see that the pin is separating right where the solder meets the trace. It doesn't look like a normal cold joint so this took me a long time to identify.
    <img src="images/re201/img54.jpg" title="img16"/>
    <img src="images/re201/img55.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Bridging the gap
    <img src="images/re201/img58.jpg" title="img16"/>
    All soldered back together and the motor is working. Now to clean up the audio circuitry.
    <img src="images/re201/img59.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Starting point
    <img src="images/re201/img74.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Finished mini board
    <img src="images/re201/img68.jpg" title="img16"/>
    I wanted to clean up the job on the new coax cable too.
    <img src="images/re201/img72.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Heat shrink helps a lot.
    <img src="images/re201/img40.jpg" title="img16"/>
    The VU meter light was burnt out so I decided to give it an upgrade.
    <img src="images/re201/img44.jpg" title="img16"/>
    An LED fits perfectly in the socket and since the VU meter is backlit, it looks hardly any different from an incandescent.
    <img src="images/re201/img45.jpg" title="img16"/>
    <img src="images/re201/img78.jpg" title="img16"/>
    I had both 201's side by side for comparison.
    <img src="images/re201/img79.jpg" title="img16"/>
    The output from the playback head was very weak compared to the good unit. I decided to service it alongside the other one and see if the issue would resolve itself.
    <img src="images/re201/img83.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Cleaning pots and switches...

    Mechanical alignment...

    Cleaning and degaussing heads...

    New tape...

    New tape vs old tape
    <img src="images/re201/img89.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Electrical adjustments...
    <img src="images/re201/img84.jpg" title="img16"/>
    At this point it was clear that it wasn't an issue that would resolve itself. While adjusting the trap coil, I noticed someone had broken the ferrite slug inside which led to a lot of leakage from the bias oscillator along with the same volume issue from before. Luckily, I was able to find a replacement slug online which fit the coil and brought the leakage way down.
    <img src="images/re201/img107.jpg" title="img16"/>
    The serviced and working unit sounded great.
    <img src="images/re201/img113.jpg" title="img16"/>
    I was pretty sure that the problem was the heads after having just gone through the entire circuit so I sent them off to be relapped.
    <img src="images/re201/img115.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Looking a lot better
    <img src="images/re201/img116.jpg" title="img16"/>
    After some head alignment, the sound was back.
    <img src="images/re201/img119.jpg" title="img16"/>
    New thumb screws and tape door hardware

    New feet
    <img src="images/re201/img122.jpg" title="img16"/>
    A final clean of the tolex and faceplate and this machine was looking and sounding better than it had in a long time.
