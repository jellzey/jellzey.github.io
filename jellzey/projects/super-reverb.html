     This 1966 Fender Super Reverb was removed from its original cabinet to function as a standalone head unit. It had most of the electronics replaced when I recieved it and was configured to have what I assume is a bias-shifting tremolo rather than the usual optical tremolo. The mod caused the amp to malfunction and it was not making sound when I recieved it. The owner had just recently purchased it and the history of the mods is unknown. We decided to restore the circuit back to the original design, neon bulb and all. There were a few other smaller problems with this amp as well and it took some time to get it back to performing as it was designed.

    I first traced the entire circuit, comparing it with an original schematic. The blue components match the schematic and the yellow ones have been changed. I drew the tremolo circuit separately to make it easier. From here you can see the reverb circuit has some high frequency attenuating capacitors and the power section has cathode resistors added.

    Here is the tremolo mod circuit. It looks like the oscillator is supposed to alter the bias through the cathode of the preamp tube.

    Here are some shots of inside the chassis. The line cord had already been replaced. The death cap and auxilliary outlet were removed as well. I'm in favor of keeping the outlet because it's a perfect spot to plug in a pedal power supply.

    The transformer matches the chassis

    New screen and cathode resistors
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img5.jpg" title="img8"/>
    I found a toasted resistor that I'm blaming on the tremolo mod.

    A shot of the whole board

    High-cut caps on the reverb tubes
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img9.jpg" title="img12"/>
    This is how the tremolo pot was wired up. Those caps provide the cathode bypassing for the tremolo tubes. Very bizarre
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img13.jpg" title="img13"/>
    The chassis was also full of holes
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img14.jpg" title="img14"/>
    At least they missed the serial number
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img15.jpg" title="img15"/>
    A bit high maybe?
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img17.jpg" title="img16"/>
    The bright switches both tested open no matter the position so I cleaned the contacts directly.

    Before
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img20.jpg" title="img16"/>
    After
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img23.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Caps removed from reverb section
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img29.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Running the original wire back to the bias supply. It had been cut and needed an extension.
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img36.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Removed all the wacky tremolo parts
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img41.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Assembled a new opto coupler
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img58.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Back to normal
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img31.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Bias on the preamp tubes back to normal too. At this point, I tested the new circuit and it sounded like it should.
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img65.jpg" title="img16"/>
    I also converted the ground switch to a feedback defeat switch. It's an easy, non-invasive mod that doubles tone options so why not?
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img51.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Aux. outlet restored
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img67.jpg" title="img16"/>
    Setting the bias
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img68.jpg" title="img16"/>
    I noticed that there were hole covers installed on the wrong side
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img69.jpg" title="img16"/>
    That just feels better
    <img src="images/super-reverb/img71.jpg" title="img16"/>
    All done and sounding much better
