        I restored this Space Echo for a local music store after it had been abandoned by a tech in the past. It had a ton of things wrong with it and it needed many hours and new parts to get it running again. When I recieved it, it was disassembled with most of the screws missing. The motor wasnt turning and to make things worse, I found that a lot of the audio wiring had been undone or redone incorrectly.

          I was originally planning on tracing the boards and using a schematic to help me reconnect the loose wires but I got lucky and another customer dropped off the same model for a tune up so I at least had a reference to take pictures of. 
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img3.jpg" title="img4">
          An entire switch missing is not a good sign. 
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img4.jpg" title="img5">
          I found the switch inside connected to a PCB. The soldering was looking pretty rough.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img6.jpg" title="img6">
          Looks like someone replaced the coax without desoldering the old stuff.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img7.jpg" title="img7">
          Where does this go??
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img8.jpg" title="img8">
          That's why I was smelling burning plastic.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img16.jpg" title="img9">
          I was very happy to have a reference machine at this point. It made this job a lot easier
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img27.jpg" title="img10">
          It was an "intence" soldering job.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img30.jpg" title="img12">
          After I made sure that the drive circuit was all there, the motor wouldn't turn. I started investigating the motor board.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img35.jpg" title="img13">
          It was almost impossible with the board soldered in the chassis so I desoldered all of the connections and began to check all the possible suspects.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img38.jpg" title="img14">
          Every single transistor tested normal and so did all of the capacitors.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img49.jpg" title="img15">
          I connected just the motor circuit back to the chassis and tested it again. It started moving but was sensitive to movement so I knew it had to be a mechanical issue.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img53.jpg" title="img16">
          The problem was barely visible but if you look closely, you can see that the pin is separating right where the solder meets the trace. It doesn't look like a normal cold joint so this took me a long time to identify.

          Bridging the gap
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img58.jpg" title="img16">
          All soldered back together and the motor is working. Now to clean up the audio circuitry.

          Starting point
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img74.jpg" title="img16">
          Finished mini board
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img68.jpg" title="img16">
          I wanted to clean up the job on the new coax cable too.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img72.jpg" title="img16">
          Heat shrink helps a lot.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img40.jpg" title="img16">
          The VU meter light was burnt out so I decided to give it an upgrade.
          <img src="images/super-reverb/img44.jpg" title="img16">
          An LED fits perfectly in the socket and since the VU meter is backlit, it looks hardly any different from an incandescent.
