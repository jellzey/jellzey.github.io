     The owner of this machine had problems getting it to record on several channels. I threaded some tape to test it out but when the machine was playing, I noticed that the tape, the tension arm, and the takeup reel had all developed a layer of sticky tar on them. The pinch roller and tape counter roller had started to melt! They were falling apart as the tape passed over them. I cut the tape off the reel and removed what was left of the rollers to send off for resurfacing.

    I sent the rollers off to
    <a href="http:\\terrysrubberrollers.com">
     Terry Witt
    </a>
    for resurfacing and started cleaning the tar out of the transport mechanism.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img4.jpg" title="img4"/>
    The rollers came back looking brand new.

    The machine recorded on half of the channels when I tested it. I decided to switch the amplifier cards around to see where the problem was.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img8.jpg" title="img6"/>
    Switching the cards around fixed all but one of the dead channels. The problem was most likely oxidation so I cleaned the contacts on the card slots. Channel 5 still had no output so I removed the channel card for a closer look.

    The first thing I noticed was discoloration around this 100&Omega; resistor. It's a dropping resistor for the -15V supply and it looked like it was getting hot. The solder also looked very thin and not consistant with the other joints.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img12.jpg" title="img8"/>
    The insulation on the leads looked like it had been replaced or had been discolored from the heat that it was experiencing.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img13.jpg" title="img9"/>
    Its a higher wattage resistor and it tested fine so I returned it to the board with some fresh solder.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img17.jpg" title="img10"/>
    I added some new insulation on the leads too. I knew that something downstream from this resistor had to be shorted out so I began checking the components that it supplies current to.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img31.jpg" title="img12"/>
    I removed two amplifier IC's to test them but they tested fine. I installed sockets in the board to make removal and testing easier in the future.

    Next, I looked at the filter caps on the -15V line. The short I was looking for was found in a 220&mu;F filter cap.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img37.jpg" title="img14"/>
    I replaced it with a cap of the same value and a higher voltage rating.
    <img src="images/tascam48/img40.jpg" title="img15"/>
    The cap in place

    Final testing. All channels are in business.
