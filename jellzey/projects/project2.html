        I picked up this reciever at a flea market for only $1 with the goal of making it function for as cheap as possible. It was missing all the chasis screws when I bought it so I was sure somebody had opened it up and messed with it in the past - usually a bad sign. Other than that though, it looked to be in pretty good shape so I went ahead and started poking around.

            After checking the line chord for shorts, I felt ok with plugging it into the wall and turning it on. The first thing I noticed was that all but one of the display bulbs had burned out.
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8179.JPG" title="img2">
          The display used these fuse lamps that run off of 8V AC directly from a transformer tap. They each draw 300mA and they're wired in parallel through a 2A fuse.
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8186.JPG" title="img4">
          Since buying new incandescent lamps would be pricey, I decided to wire two LED's in parallel with their polarities reversed and connect them in series with a current limiting resistor to the 8V AC. I chose a 220 ohm resistor which at 4 volts gives just under 20mA. I soldered them directly to the bulbs and popped them back in the sockets. I also replaced the 2A fuse with a 1A because the LED's don't draw nearly as much current. 
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8180.JPG" title="img5">
          To test the amplifier circuit, I connected two 8 Ohm dummy loads to the output and sent a 1kHz sine wave through the aux input. The left channel tested fine, outputting around 11 Watts. When I moved the pan knob to the right side, however, one of the high wattage resistors began smoking so I cut the power and checked out the right channel amplifier.
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8187.JPG" title="img6">
          Here is a shot of the insides of the amp. I had to remove the newly replaced display lights to get to the power amplifier circuit underneath. Each channel uses two BJT's that are screwed in to the aluminum heatsink. With a visual inspection, I didn't notice anything that looked charred. I also tested the resistor that got hot and it was within spec.

          After poking around with a multimeter for a short to ground, I tried testing the power transistors with a component tester. Both transistors failed super bad. One of them looked like a short from emitter to base and the other blew open. I ordered some NTE-152's to replace them. I also noticed while I was searching for a short that someone had replaced the 2A audio output fuse with a 4A on one channel and a 3A on the other. That explains why the transistors were fried.
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8181.JPG" title="img8">
          After screwing the new NTE-152's into the heatsink with some heat transfer paste and insulation, I soldered them both into the right channel and replaced the fuses with the correct values. Using the same test as before, I got good readings for both channels. Here's a shot of the scope with the pan knob turned just off center. Both channels are putting out 11 Watts now. 
          <img src="images/project2/IMG_8192.JPG" title="img9">
          The last step was de-oxing all of the switches and pots to rid the controls of their scratchy-stickiness. Testing with speakers, the amp sounded good on both channels so I decided to call it on this one.
